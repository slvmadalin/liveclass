    <h2>Wait, what?</h2>
    <p>wait a minute,i said i wanted simple,but not boring.What is up with this design? there's nothing on it but white space and some text and a minimal picture.that's not what i had in mind.The type is all in Helvetica,which i like,but it doesn't excite me at all. There is just no character to anything here. It has a minimal look,but it's just too vanilla. I really need something to grab the attention of a visitor to the site and this just doesn't do it.</p>
